    <p>Check out this  this easy chicken broccoli rice casserole recipe, which is one of her family’s go-to weeknight 
        meals, and I instantly knew it would be a hit in my house as well.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With about 10 minutes of prep, this dump-and-bake chicken broccoli rice casserole is an easy dinner that cooks 
        in one dish! There’s no need to pre-cook the rice, pre-cook the chicken, or sauté the veggies, so the comfort 
        food meal is an ideal option to pop in the oven for busy weeknights.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 10.5 oz can of condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth, water, or milk</li>
        <li>1 cup of uncooked long grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 lb uncooked boneless chiken breast, diced</li>
        <li>1 12.6 bag frozen broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>optional herbs, and seasoning of choice, such as garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, thyme, rosemary, basil, oregano,
            chives, parsley, or seasoned salt
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9 x 13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. In the prepared dish 
            whisk together the cream of chicken soup and the chicken broth
        </li>
        <li>Stir in uncooked rice, the uncooked chicken, and the frozen broccoli. Season with herbs, spices, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly with foil and bake for 55-60 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed, the rice is tender 
            and the chicken is cooked through. Use a fork to fluff the rice. If your rice is still too firm after 1 hour, cover the dish 
            again and return to the oven for 5-10 more minutes. Be careful not to overcook the rice. 
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the dish with cheese, and return to the oven for a few more minutes, until the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped herbs is desired, serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
